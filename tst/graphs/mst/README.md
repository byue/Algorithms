# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Overview

The **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** problem is a classic optimization problem in graph theory. Given a connected, weighted graph, the goal is to find a spanning tree (a subset of the edges) that connects all vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

MSTs have important applications in network design, circuit design, clustering, and many other areas where connectivity and optimization are critical.

## Problem Definition

Given an undirected, connected graph \( G = (V, E) \), where:
- \( V \) is the set of vertices,
- \( E \) is the set of edges, with each edge \( e \in E \) having a non-negative weight \( w(e) \),
the objective is to find a tree that spans all vertices (i.e., a connected subgraph) and has the minimum total weight of edges.

### Example

For a graph with vertices \( A, B, C, D \) and weighted edges:

| Edge  | Weight |
|-------|--------|
| (A, B) | 4      |
| (A, C) | 3      |
| (B, C) | 5      |
| (B, D) | 6      |
| (C, D) | 7      |

The minimum spanning tree (MST) might consist of edges:
- (A, C) with weight 3
- (A, B) with weight 4
- (B, D) with weight 6

The total weight of the MST is 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

## Algorithms for MST

Several algorithms exist to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph. The most common ones are **Kruskal's Algorithm**, **Prim's Algorithm**, and **Borůvka's Algorithm**.

### 1. Kruskal’s Algorithm

#### Purpose:
Kruskal’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST by considering edges in increasing order of weight and adding them to the tree as long as they don’t form a cycle.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \( O(E \log E) \), where \( E \) is the number of edges.
- **Space complexity**: \( O(V) \) for storing the disjoint-set structure.

#### Steps:
1. Sort all the edges in increasing order of their weight.
2. Add edges one by one to the MST by checking if they form a cycle using a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure.
3. Stop when there are \( V-1 \) edges in the MST (where \( V \) is the number of vertices).

#### Applications:
- **Network design**: Designing efficient communication networks.
- **Clustering**: Hierarchical clustering in machine learning.

### 2. Prim’s Algorithm

#### Purpose:
Prim’s algorithm is another greedy algorithm that starts with a single vertex and grows the MST one edge at a time, selecting the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to one outside it.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \( O(E \log V) \) when using a priority queue (min-heap).
- **Space complexity**: \( O(V) \) for storing the MST and the priority queue.

#### Steps:
1. Start with any arbitrary vertex as the initial tree.
2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
3. Add the selected edge to the MST and update the priority queue.
4. Repeat until all vertices are included in the MST.

#### Applications:
- **Network design**: For finding the minimum cost to connect a set of points (e.g., network routers).
- **Power grid optimization**: Connecting power plants with minimal cost.

### 3. Borůvka’s Algorithm

#### Purpose:
Borůvka’s algorithm is a parallelizable greedy algorithm that adds edges in stages, with each stage selecting the minimum weight edge for each connected component of the graph.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \( O(E \log V) \) when using efficient data structures for union-find.
- **Space complexity**: \( O(V) \).

#### Steps:
1. Initially, each vertex is its own component.
2. For each component, find the minimum weight edge that connects it to another component.
3. Add the selected edges to the MST and merge the components.
4. Repeat until all vertices are in a single connected component.

#### Applications:
- **Distributed systems**: Borůvka’s algorithm is well-suited for parallel and distributed computing.
- **Networking**: For building minimal spanning networks in distributed environments.

## Applications of MST

MSTs have a wide range of applications in real-world problems:

- **Network Design**: Minimizing the cost of laying down cables or wires to connect a set of points (e.g., building the cheapest communication network).
- **Clustering**: In hierarchical clustering, an MST is used to group data points in machine learning.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Some approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, rely on MSTs.
- **Computer Graphics**: For 3D mesh generation and optimizing graphical networks.
- **Urban Planning**: Designing the minimum infrastructure layout for roads or utilities.

## Comparison of MST Algorithms

| Algorithm        | Time Complexity      | Space Complexity     | Description                                    |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Kruskal’s**    | \( O(E \log E) \)    | \( O(V) \)           | Efficient for sparse graphs, uses a union-find structure. |
| **Prim’s**       | \( O(E \log V) \)    | \( O(V) \)           | Efficient for dense graphs, uses a priority queue. |
| **Borůvka’s**    | \( O(E \log V) \)    | \( O(V) \)           | Parallelizable, works well for distributed systems. |

## Choosing the Right Algorithm

- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: Best for graphs with fewer edges (sparse graphs).
- **Prim’s Algorithm**: Works well for dense graphs or when edges are added one at a time.
- **Borůvka’s Algorithm**: Ideal for parallel or distributed systems.

## Summary
