# Modified Binary Search

## Overview

**Modified Binary Search** is an adaptation of the classic binary search algorithm, designed to find the index of the first element in a sorted sequence that fails a given condition. This modified approach extends binary search by using a condition function, which allows for more flexibility compared to searching for an exact value.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this modified binary search is to efficiently find the first index in a sorted sequence where a provided condition fails. Instead of looking for a specific target value, it allows the search to be based on any arbitrary condition.

This method can be used for a variety of scenarios where you need to find a threshold or the point at which a certain property (e.g., comparison, limit) changes.

## Theory

### Basic Idea

In the standard binary search, we search for a specific value. In this modification, instead of searching for a fixed value, we apply a condition (usually a function) to each element. The algorithm searches for the first element in the sequence that does **not** satisfy the condition.

1. **Condition Function**: The condition function takes an element from the sequence and returns a boolean. The search aims to find the index where the condition first fails.
2. **Search Process**: Just like traditional binary search, the search space is halved on each iteration:
   - If the condition holds true for the middle element, the search continues to the right half.
   - If the condition fails for the middle element, the search continues to the left half.

The algorithm returns the index where the condition fails for the first time.

### Example

Given a sorted array of integers, if the condition is to find the first index where the element is greater than or equal to a threshold value, binary search would efficiently find that threshold.

## Runtime

The time complexity of this modified binary search is **O(log n)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the sequence. This is the same as the classical binary search, as the search space is halved with each iteration.

- **Best Case**: O(1) — when the first element fails the condition.
- **Average Case**: O(log n) — typically, the condition fails after a few steps of halving.
- **Worst Case**: O(log n) — the search interval keeps halving until it is exhausted or the condition fails.

This logarithmic time complexity ensures the algorithm is efficient even with large datasets.

## Applications

The modified binary search is used in several situations, such as:

- **Threshold Search**: Finding the first element that meets or exceeds a certain threshold. For example, finding the first value greater than a target in a sorted array.
- **Finding Boundary Conditions**: In optimization problems, binary search is often used to find the point where a condition (like a limit or tolerance) is first violated.
- **Search for the First False Condition**: In problems where you want to find the index of the first element that doesn't satisfy a condition, such as identifying the first "outlier" or invalid value in sorted data.
- **Time-sensitive Applications**: When dealing with sorted time-series data, you may need to quickly find the first time when a certain event or condition fails (e.g., a threshold being crossed).

## Comparison to Classical Binary Search

- **Classical Binary Search**: Traditional binary search looks for a specific target value in a sorted array.
- **Modified Binary Search**: This variant is more flexible, as it uses a condition function that can apply to a broader range of problems. Instead of searching for a single value, it finds the first occurrence where the condition fails.
  
  - **Condition-based Flexibility**: In contrast to classical binary search, which is limited to looking for a fixed value, the modified version can work with any boolean condition.
  - **Threshold Finding**: The modified binary search is particularly useful when searching for threshold values, where the search does not stop at a specific value but at the first failure of a condition.

## Summary

Modified binary search is a powerful adaptation of the classical binary search algorithm, allowing it to find the index of the first element in a sorted sequence where a condition fails. With its **O(log n)** time complexity, it provides an efficient way to handle problems involving threshold detection or conditions applied to a sorted dataset. This version is more flexible than classical binary search and can be used in a wide range of applications, from threshold-based searching to boundary detection and optimization problems.
