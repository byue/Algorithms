# Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations of fundamental and advanced algorithms and data structures. It is designed for general-purpose use, including problem-solving, academic learning, and technical interview preparation. The algorithms cover a broad range of topics, from classic data structures to modern techniques, and aim to provide both efficient solutions and clear code examples to enhance your understanding of algorithm design and optimization.

## Prerequisites
Ensure Python3 is installed.

## Installation and Running

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

The algorithms and data structures concepts in this repository were inspired by courses from the following institutions:

- **Princeton University Coursera Courses**: These courses offer a deep dive into algorithms and data structures. See [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) for more details.
  
- **MIT OpenCourseWare**: The [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2020/video_galleries/lecture-videos/) course as well as the [Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/video_galleries/lecture-videos/) course from MIT OpenCourseWare provided key insights and methodologies for this project.

- **University of Washington CSE 421**: The [CSE 421: Algorithms Lecture Notes](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/24au/) served as another essential reference for the development of algorithmic techniques in this repository.
